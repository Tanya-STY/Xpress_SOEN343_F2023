## Project Approach
* Frontend Framework: React.js will serve as the frontend framework of choice due to its component-based architecture and ease of development. It allows for efficient UI/UX design and modular code organization. 
* Backend Framework: Express.js, a robust and flexible Node.js framework, will be utilized for building the backend infrastructure. It provides a reliable foundation for creating RESTful APIs, handling routing, and managing middleware.
